# Book_Search
An application designed to use the Google Books API to find and save books of interest

## Installation
- Install and run a MongoDB instance
- Clone the repo and CD into "Book_Search"
- Run 'npm run install' to install all necessary node dependencies
- Run 'npm run debug' to start the client and server together
- Alternatively, you can CD into either the '/client' or '/server' folders and run 'npm run start' to start each respective component. HOWEVER, both components must be running simultaneously for the project to work
